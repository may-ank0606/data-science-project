The House Price Prediction Model is a machine learning project hosted on GitHub that aims to predict the prices of residential properties based on various features. The model utilizes advanced regression techniques to analyze historical housing data and make accurate predictions on the market value of houses.

This repository provides a comprehensive implementation of a house price prediction model, including the necessary code, datasets, and documentation. It serves as a valuable resource for data scientists, researchers, and enthusiasts interested in the field of real estate analytics and predictive modeling.

Key Features:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: The project includes scripts and utilities to gather and preprocess the housing dataset. This ensures that the data is cleaned, transformed, and ready for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Extensive EDA is performed to gain insights into the dataset. Visualizations and statistical summaries are provided to understand the relationships between different features and the target variable (house prices).

Feature Engineering: The repository demonstrates various feature engineering techniques used to extract meaningful information from the raw data. This step involves transforming, combining, or creating new features to improve the predictive power of the model.
